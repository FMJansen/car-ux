Mercedes-Benz wants to appeal to a younger audience. Therefore the multimedia system looks glossy, with some traditional and classic details. The entire look is very much in line with the level of class Mercedes-Benz is known for, impressive. </br></br>The rotary knob and the touchpad are incorporated in the dashboard and look stylish. But it takes some time to get used to the rotary knob and the touchpad. It also takes some time to get used to the fact that there is a lot of information on the screen. The options are endless, so it is often difficult to choose. It is also confusing that you can get to sub-tasks in different ways. Also, the touchpad does not always work intuitive, for example when deleting data. </br></br>The screen on the dashboard can be easily viewed from the driver seat. Even in daylight, the screen is still legible. It\’s to bad that the screen does not always automatically switches to the correct light mode when you\'re in a tunnel or dark environment. In a tunnel, the screen is pretty bright, but this is not distracting or blinding.',
