        Of course we can not ignore the success since 2007 of the Qashqai. On February 2014, the updated version of the Qashqai can be admired on the road. The new design is striking, but has some similarities with the previous model. There were rumors that the Qashqai is full of exciting new technology. We were curious and ready to be suprised in our review.',

The color scheme is based on a black background. Blue is used to label buttons, white for text or primary actions and orange for active components or interactive elements. Some colors in the navigation and icons are used inconsistent and random. But overall there is a clear and consistent use of colors and control visualisations. </b><br/><br/>
In the interior there is an orange ambient lighting applied. This color can also be found in the interface. A nice detail that connects the interface with the interior.',

        The Nissan is equipped with two displays. A 5 inch in the middle of the console, and one between the dials. Both displays work smoothly. You experience no delays or glitches in the menus. The screens themselves demonstrate a clear and sharp image and give you the feeling of a good quality. All is perfectly legible. Even if you\'re dealing with lots of light. the screen that sits on the middle of your dashboard however, is not legible when the glass roof is open.<br/><br/>Each menu offers a limited but clear set of options to choose from. While driving ofcourse you don\'t want to get lost in a maze of options that are not even relevant at the time.<br/><br/> The automatic parking option we see in more and more cars these days. It can provide a helping hand, especially in tight parking areas. It just takes a bit of preperation setting up for automatic parking. If you are a skilled driver, it is still often faster to do it manualy than the automatic function.',
