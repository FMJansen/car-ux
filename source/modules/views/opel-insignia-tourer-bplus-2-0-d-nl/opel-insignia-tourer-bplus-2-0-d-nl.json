It is a big boy that takes a prominent place on the dashboard. The buttons are all nicely rounded and neatly positioned below the display. Fortunately, there are less buttons than in the previous version of the Insignia. This makes it more quiet for the driver. So prominent and large as the central display, so smallish look the analogue gauges for speed and speed. They are however beautiful, although from time to time we had to give it some effort, to see what the current speed was, when it was not given on the small display.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe information on the dashboard screen is clear. The fuel consumption and range are displayed in submenus. That are accessible by controls on the steering wheel. The menu structures are divided both vertically and horizontally, and that gives some confusion within such a small screen. Unfortunately no warnings are displayed on the screen.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tInteraction by way of touching the screen works moderately. This is because not all of the controls are effective. The knob works fine, but requires a lot of concentration. You have to long press the screen looking for the illogical structure of options. The buttons on the steering wheel work, but are confusing with what happens next in the menu. The touchpad that is part of the center console, is designed to facilitate the easy input of information. For example, you can draw figures. However, this requires a lot of attention from the driver, making it more a funny gadget than a functional addition that you will use often.\n</p>","summary_title":"The screen is part of the car","summary_visual":{"height":200,"resize_url":"http://lh4.ggpht.com/tXkv-RPFtbBtNop1aJ04pU_o2QN1dDm0rAOxwHMZjRAdXXQmff3mCx_lkYfRk9Vx4QeqhLLqXaUmUqGFIVtZjszdzoLb","size":70731,"type":"image/jpeg","url":"/webhook-uploads/1425999469220/opel-insignia-summary.jpg","width":900},"tagline":"Tested on May 15 2014 by Hylke van Maaren, Helder Mota and Robbert Ouwerkerk","title":"Opel Insignia","title_image":{"height":50,"resize_url":"http://lh4.ggpht.com/RCFFyCtUr2CnUDLxjS9d65XW7aqOYzYCuOfYUQRLJgP9mJL6WX-4TdbLZz2yNYWMpnslekc9dh5Vx7a_sbu-8iJOS9EU","size":2644,"type":"image/jpeg","url":"/webhook-uploads/1425999011697/opel-insignia-small.jpg","width":100},"title_image_alt_text":"Opel Insignia","twitter":"Opel Insignia Sports Tourer Business+ 2.0 CDTI.

This is located next to the handbrake. The touchpad can be used as \"drawing pad\" for entering text or numbers. You activate it with a button that is next to it. Every action with the touchpad requires text input, for example destinations in case of navigating. Although the letter recognition works reasonably well, drawing letters takes quite some effort and time. The fact that no support is offered in the form of predictive results or filters based on the current input, this input method is very time consuming and error prone. Another small annoyance is that the touchpad does not have an 'ENTER' or 'OK' option. This means that you still need to touch the screen to proceed to the next step.
