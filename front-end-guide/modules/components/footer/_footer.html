			<h1>CAR UI is an initiative of UNITiD interaction designers</h1>
			<p>
                Digital interactive displays are popping up in all new produced cars. And with this trend, new problems of interaction arise, that were long covered in the era of physical buttons and sliders. With our experience in digital design we believed that it was time to pinpoint those problems, and started our CAR UI initiative.
